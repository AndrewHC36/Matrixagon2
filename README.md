# Matrixagon 2
An experimental open-world voxel renderer using Vulkan with focus on interesting novel techniques in computer graphics, reinforcement learning, and weather simulation.

### TODO
- Debug the new `IndexedBuffer` struct not working

## Status
Will take a break from implementing this project for now

## Current Knowledge State
- Mesh Fill List Algorithm
- Chunking
- Shaders (water rendering)
- Renderpasses (w/ Debug UI)

## Future Plans on GPU Rendering
- MTXG2
- MTXG2RL
- MTXG2GP
